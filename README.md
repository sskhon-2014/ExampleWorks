Here is an example of some of my work. Please take some time to look around!

# CosineSimilarityAlgorithm.ipynb
This is a cosine similarity algorithm I designed. It uses gensim's word2vec model trained on text8 to compare individual words in a document and through repetition and the use of thresholds the algorithm can effectively calculate the percent similarity between documents. The only downside of this algorithm is, however, that it does not efficiently compute the percent similarity in large documents. This algorithm was used to convert the local diagnoses in ResultCare's database to the universal standard ICD9. This is a novel approach to Natural Language Processing because it essentially implents a highly complex word search.
